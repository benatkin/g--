Hides the google+ notification count on www.google.com so I'm not distracted my google+
notifications while I'm searching.

Inspired by [g-](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dgpdknjcnmdopmgoajdcphdlcgdfdpfp),
but applies the CSS before the DOM is loaded, so it doesn't flicker.

# TODO

* Add the ability to set which google sites to hide the notification count on.
